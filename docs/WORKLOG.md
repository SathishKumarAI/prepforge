## 2026-07-13 21:47 — UI redesign completed (59/59) + Quiz roadmap shipped

**Summary:** Closed out the entire UI-REDESIGN-BACKLOG (59/59) and the QUIZ-BACKLOG
roadmap — including an end-to-end, zero-token "quiz from a YouTube video" pipeline
and four synthesized question kinds. Every batch verified with `tsc --noEmit` +
`vite build`; backend synth logic unit-checked. Servers left running: backend 8787,
frontend 5173.

**Changes:**
- `frontend` UI — real type-scale tokens (display→micro) applied app-wide; `SectionDivider`;
  global reduced-motion via `MotionConfig`; single topic→accent source; syntax highlighting
  (lean `rehype-highlight-lite` lowlight plugin) + `ReadingPane` (TOC, scroll persistence,
  reading mode); unified `ui/chip` (replaced 5 copy-pasted toggles); Reader feedback → Sonner;
  WCAG AA fixes for light-theme metadata tokens; Browse windowed rendering (IntersectionObserver);
  ArticleReader + SourceDoc migrated to Radix `Dialog`.
- `frontend` Quiz — exit + resume (localStorage `pf-quiz-run`); weakness-aware selection; timed
  mode (countdown + auto-miss); results review with per-question explanations; persisted config
  (`pf-quiz-config`); "Quiz from a YouTube video" input; renders `quiz.kind`/`quiz.prompt`.
- `frontend` Resources — "＋ quiz" button per card → generate + open scoped quiz.
- `backend` — `transcript.py` (YouTube captions → chunked markdown); `capture.read` pulls the
  transcript; `ingest` attaches `sources:[{title,path,kind:"library"}]` + a local TF-IDF index for
  near-miss distractors + four question kinds (mcq/cloze/truefalse/spotwrong); endpoints
  `/quiz/from_video`, `/quiz/from_resource`, `/library/read`; `youtube-transcript-api` dep.
- `docs` — UI-REDESIGN-BACKLOG (59/59 ✅), QUIZ-BACKLOG, UI-BUTTONS updated as Kanban.

**Decisions:**
- Kept everything **zero-token**: MCQ synthesis, TF-IDF distractors, and all four question kinds
  are deterministic. True/false and spot-the-wrong are labelled *by construction* (pairing a
  subject with its own vs. a dissimilar card's gloss) — no model needed to guarantee correctness.
- Dropped `rehype-highlight` (bundled ~37 grammars, +59kB gzip) for a curated 7-grammar lowlight
  plugin; net highlighting cost ~+22kB gzip.
- Windowed (IntersectionObserver) rendering over true virtualization — cards are expandable/animated.

**Follow-ups:**
- [ ] Optional Ollama/Claude ingest tier (would enable richer, model-written quizzes).
- [ ] `src/hooks/useEscapeKey.ts` is now an orphan (readers moved to Radix Dialog) — delete pending OK.
- [ ] Author the remaining cached answer lenses (~1651 vault Qs, ~100 curated).
