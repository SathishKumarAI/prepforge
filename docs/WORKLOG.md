## 2026-07-13 21:47 — UI redesign completed (59/59) + Quiz roadmap shipped

**Summary:** Closed out the entire UI-REDESIGN-BACKLOG (59/59) and the QUIZ-BACKLOG
roadmap — including an end-to-end, zero-token "quiz from a YouTube video" pipeline
and four synthesized question kinds. Every batch verified with `tsc --noEmit` +
`vite build`; backend synth logic unit-checked. Servers left running: backend 8787,
frontend 5173.

**Changes:**
- `frontend` UI — real type-scale tokens (display→micro) applied app-wide; `SectionDivider`;
  global reduced-motion via `MotionConfig`; single topic→accent source; syntax highlighting
  (lean `rehype-highlight-lite` lowlight plugin) + `ReadingPane` (TOC, scroll persistence,
  reading mode); unified `ui/chip` (replaced 5 copy-pasted toggles); Reader feedback → Sonner;
  WCAG AA fixes for light-theme metadata tokens; Browse windowed rendering (IntersectionObserver);
  ArticleReader + SourceDoc migrated to Radix `Dialog`.
- `frontend` Quiz — exit + resume (localStorage `pf-quiz-run`); weakness-aware selection; timed
  mode (countdown + auto-miss); results review with per-question explanations; persisted config
  (`pf-quiz-config`); "Quiz from a YouTube video" input; renders `quiz.kind`/`quiz.prompt`.
- `frontend` Resources — "＋ quiz" button per card → generate + open scoped quiz.
- `backend` — `transcript.py` (YouTube captions → chunked markdown); `capture.read` pulls the
  transcript; `ingest` attaches `sources:[{title,path,kind:"library"}]` + a local TF-IDF index for
  near-miss distractors + four question kinds (mcq/cloze/truefalse/spotwrong); endpoints
  `/quiz/from_video`, `/quiz/from_resource`, `/library/read`; `youtube-transcript-api` dep.
- `docs` — UI-REDESIGN-BACKLOG (59/59 ✅), QUIZ-BACKLOG, UI-BUTTONS updated as Kanban.

**Decisions:**
- Kept everything **zero-token**: MCQ synthesis, TF-IDF distractors, and all four question kinds
  are deterministic. True/false and spot-the-wrong are labelled *by construction* (pairing a
  subject with its own vs. a dissimilar card's gloss) — no model needed to guarantee correctness.
- Dropped `rehype-highlight` (bundled ~37 grammars, +59kB gzip) for a curated 7-grammar lowlight
  plugin; net highlighting cost ~+22kB gzip.
- Windowed (IntersectionObserver) rendering over true virtualization — cards are expandable/animated.

**Follow-ups:**
- [ ] Optional Ollama/Claude ingest tier (would enable richer, model-written quizzes).
- [ ] `src/hooks/useEscapeKey.ts` is now an orphan (readers moved to Radix Dialog) — delete pending OK.
- [ ] Author the remaining cached answer lenses (~1651 vault Qs, ~100 curated).

## 2026-08-28 — Local model for six of the seven lenses; the generate gate comes off

**Summary:** Pointed the generated answer lenses at a local model served by LM Studio, then removed
the press-to-generate confirmation the tab row had gained the same day. The two are one change:
the gate existed only because every lens was a billed Anthropic call, and six of them no longer are.
Verified with a stub LM Studio server (`test_local_provider.py`, 5/5), `tsc --noEmit` exit 0 and
`vite build`. The real LM Studio path is **not** verified — its server was not running on this
machine.

**Changes:**
- `backend/generate.py` — provider routing. `deep` stays on Claude with `web_search`; the other six
  modes go to LM Studio's OpenAI-compatible server when it answers, and fall back to Claude when it
  does not. `local_model()` probes `/v1/models` on a 10s TTL; `_strip_reasoning()` drops the
  `<think>` blocks Qwen3/gpt-oss emit inline. `LMSTUDIO_URL` / `LMSTUDIO_MODEL` / `LMSTUDIO_TIMEOUT`.
- `backend/main.py` — `GET /generate/providers`: which modes are free right now, and the local
  model's id.
- `backend/test_local_provider.py` — new. Stub HTTP server, not a mock, because the thing under test
  is an HTTP shape a mocked client would pass with the wrong JSON keys.
- `frontend` — `DeepAnswer` loses `mayGenerate`; `QuestionDetail` loses `pressed`; the "Generate it"
  empty state becomes the spinner the fetch shows anyway. `useFreeModes` and `fetchProviders`
  deleted with them.
- `docs`, `README`, `.env.example`, `STATUS.md` — the provider split, the missing confirm step, and
  what is still unverified.

**Decisions:**
- **Local answers cache under a further `__local` suffix.** Sharing the slot would let a cheap local
  answer permanently shadow a Claude one for the same question and lens, with nothing in the UI to
  say which you were reading.
- **The model id is probed, not configured.** It is changed from LM Studio's own UI, and a stale
  `LMSTUDIO_MODEL` fails with a 404 that reads exactly like the server being down.
- **`deep` never routes local.** Its value is real citations; a local model producing them
  unsourced would be the worst version of this feature.
- **The gate came off knowingly.** With LM Studio off, all seven lenses are Claude calls again and a
  slow sweep across the tab row bills several. `peekTab`'s 400ms hover-intent delay is now the only
  brake, which is why it is documented in three places rather than left as UI polish.

**Follow-ups:**
- [ ] Verify the local path against a real LM Studio — start the server, hover a lens, confirm the
      meta row shows the local model id and `$0.0000`.
- [ ] Cap concurrent generations; LM Studio serializes them and a fast sweep queues dead work.
- [ ] Show the provider in the UI — `meta.provider` is returned but only the model id is displayed.
